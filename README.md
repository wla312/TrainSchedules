# TrainSchedules

A train schedule application that provides up-to-date information about various train arrival times.

App uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 

The app retrieves and manipulates the arrival and departure information from Firebase using Moment.js. 

To replicate this application, you will need to provide your own firebase config credentials (refer to firebase documentation and lines 10-17 of app.js).
